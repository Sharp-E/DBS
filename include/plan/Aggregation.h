/*!
 * `Aggregation` is the physical plan for aggregations. This physical plan
 * should remember its child plan, aggregation types, and a set of expressions
 * conducted on input columns from its child. By the end of construction, it
 * should also look up and remember corresponding aggregation functions for
 * further execution.
 *
 * You should use `g_catcache->FindAggregationByTidAndOprType` to locate the
 * aggregation id given the type of the aggregation (see
 * include/catalog/aggtyp.h), and the type of operand (i.e., the aggregated
 * expression).  Then you can leverage
 * `g_catcache->FindAggregation(aggregation_id)` to get the construct
 * containing function IDs for initialize, accumulate and finalize function of
 * a particular aggregation operator defined by \p apptyp.
 *
 * Later on, to use these aggregate functions during execution, you can simply
 * look up function IDs through `FindBuiltinFuction()` to get the raw function
 * pointer and call the function through `FunctionCall()`.
 *
 * The output schema of aggregation should be based on the aggregation output
 * of all aggregating expressions. It can be derived from the return types of
 * aggregation expressions.
