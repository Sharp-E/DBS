/*!
 * An RAII-style guard for a pinned buffer frame, which is unpinned when it
 * goes out of its scope. A typical usage is:
 *
 *  {
 *      char *buf;
 *      ScopedBufferId bufid = g_bufman->PinPage(some_pid, &buf);
 *      // do something with the buffered page
 *  } // buffer pin automatically dropped at the end of the current scope
 *
 * Note that this is only meant to be a convenient tool for you to write
 * correct code, but you should always keep an eye on when and where the buffer
 * pin is dropped.  Suppose bufid is a ScopedBufferId, excplicitly calling
 * g_bufman->UnpinPage(bufid) is safe, as it resets it upon retrun.  However,
 * it is not safe to call g_bufman->UnpinPage(bufid.Get()) without resetting
 * it, because you will end up with a double "unpin" at the end of the scope.

 * \p BufferManager implements a steal and no-force buffer pool with a fixed
 * number of page frames to buffer the pages in the regular files. It should
 * track which page is currently pinned and how many times it is currently
 * pinned, as well as whether it is dirty. When someone requests a pin on a
 * page, it should return either an existing buffer frame that buffers the
 * page, or returns a free buffer frame (possibly evicting some clean pages)
 * and reads the page from the file manager into the buffer frame.
 *
 * A note on buffer Id assignment: all valid values of the type BufferId except
 * `INVALID_BUFID` may be used for denote a buffer frame. There's no
 * restriction on how to assign BufferId values to each buffer frame (meaning
 * you could use any subset of values to denote the buffer frames). However,
 * the implementation should guarantee that, given the same buffer pool size,
 * 1) the same buffer frame is always denoted with the same buffer ID in a
 * BufferManager instance (i.e., the same buffer frame should be denoted with
 * the same buffer ID regardless what page it is holding); 2) and the set of
 * valid buffer ID stays the same in different BufferManager instances (i.e., a
 * valid (resp. invaild) buffer ID in a BufferManager should also be valid
 * (resp. invalid) in a BufferManager initialized with the same buffer pool
 * size).
 *
 * You may ignore any latch related functions since we won't be implementing
 * concurrency control and recovery.
