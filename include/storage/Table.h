/*!
 * Table implements a heap file over the virtual file provided by the
 * FileManager. A heap file manages a list of data pages, and supports
 * inserting, deleting, updating and forward-iterating the records stored in
 * the file. A Table object and its iterators should use the buffer manager to
 * access its pages, rather than directly going through the File interface.
 *
 * Note:
 * 1. You may assume tabisvarlen in the table entry of the table descriptor
 * passed to the Table class is always `true`.
 * 2. Table may have a non-trivial constructor and/or a non-trivial destructor,
 * but they must not throw any error.
 * 3. A Table object should not store any heap file's meta data or content
 * locally, so that two Table objects created on the same heap file should be
 * able to see the effect of each other as long as there's no data race.
