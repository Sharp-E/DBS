/*!
 * VarlenDataPage implements a buffered heap page that supports inserting,
 * deleting, updating and random accessing variable-length records on the page.
 * Note that this class does not need to parse or validate the record payload.
 * Rather it may treat each record as an array of bytes of variable length.
 *
 * Note:
 *  1. A variable-length data page must have `PageHeaderData` (see
 *  `storage/FileManager.h`) at the beginning and it may not modify anything in
 *   the bytes occupied by the `PageHeaderData`.
 *  2. Records must be stored at offsets that are aligned to the maximum
 *  aligment requirement (using `MAXALIGN()` in `base/tdb_base.h`). You may
 *  assume any buffer passed to VarlenDataPage is properly aligned (at least
 *  maxaligned addresses). A record payload must not share the same 8 bytes at
 *  some 8-byte boundaries with a slot. For instance, it is not allowed to put
 *  a record of length 4 at offset 4080, with a `SlotData` at offset 4084. If
 *  only 4 bytes left in the free space, you cannot fit any record even if
 *  its actual length is <= 4.
 *  3. Any valid slot ID on this page must be in the range of
 *  [`GetMinSlotId()`, `GetMaxSlotId()`] (the valid range of slot id). You may
 *  use the function `CheckSID()` to validate whether an \p sid falls into this
 *  range. Unless the page is empty, `GetMaxSlotId()` should always be an
 *  occupied slot with the largest slot id on this page (see GetMaxSlotId() for
 *  details).
 *  4. VarlenDataPage should not store any page content locally in the class,
 *  so that two VarlenDataPage constructed on the same page buffer should
 *  be able to see the effect of each other as long as there's no data race.
 *  5. VarlenDataPage should have a trivial destructor and thus should not have
 *  a user-defined destructor.
 *  6. The implementation must perform lazy compaction instead of eager
 *  compaction. In other words, a compaction operation may not be triggered if
 *  it would be the last step **after** a record payload is shortened or
 *  removed (due to update or deletion). On the other hand, it is permissible
 *  to perform a compaction **before** a record payload needs to be extended or
 *  inserted (due to update or insertion).
